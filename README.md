#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of enineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing and evaluation of software systems. It involves using established methodologies and best practices to create software that is relaible, efficient and scalable. 
These are the key aspects of software engineering: 
1. Requirements analysis
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Maintenance
6. Project Management
   
The following are the important aspects of software engineering in the Technology industry:
1. Quality assurance
2. Scalability
3. Efficiency
4. Innovation
5. Economic Impact
6. Interdisciplinary collaboration
7. Adaptability

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Structured programming (1960s) : emerged as a response to the growing complexitynof software systems. structured programming introduced the concept of breaking down a program into smaller, manageable sections or modules using control structures like loop, conditionals and subroutines.
2. Object-oriented programming - OOP (1980s) : This introduced a new paradigm that focused on representing software as a collection of objects. each objects contains dtata (attributes) and behavior (methods), allowing for the creation of modular, reusable and scalable code. This approach contrasts with procedural programming, where the focus is on writing functions or procedures.
3. Agile Methodologies (2000s) : Emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, linear software development, collaboration, flexibilityu and customer feedback. It introduced practices such as scrum and kanban, which focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements to software rather than large, monolithic releases.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The cycle is structured process used for developing software systems. It consists of several phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables. The following are the main phases:
1. Planning : This is the initial phase that involves defining scope, objectives and purpose of the software project. It includes feasibility analysis, resource allocation and rist assessment. The goal is to ensure that the project is viable and aligns with business needs.
2. Requirement analysis: A detailed requirements for the software are gathered and documented.
3. Design : The software's architecture and detailed design are created based on the requirements.
4. Implementation (Coding) : The actual coding takes place. Developers write code based on the design specifications.
5. Testing : The software is tested to identify and fix defects.
6. Deployment : After successful testing, the software is deployed to a production environment where it becomes available for users
7. Maintenenance : after deployment the software enters the maintenance phase where it is monitored and updated to fix bugs, improve performance and adapt to new requirements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology : it is like following a step-by-step guide to build. each step to be done completely before one can work on the next step. How it works: 1. Plan first and build later 2. Do each part of the project in a specific order and don't move to the next until the current step is fully done. It is appropriate to be used if :
1. if you know what exactly what kind of castle you want and you don't expect any suprises.
2. When you have to follow strict instructions and can't change anything once you start.

Agile Methodology : This approac allows one to work with others or a team where you all work on different parts at the same time and one is free to make changes whenever you want.
For it to work one has to build a little, test it out and if you want to change something you can. Team mates can share ideas and work together and once can adjust things quickly if someone has a new idea.
Its is good to be used when:
1. If one wants to be creative and try new ideas as one goes. One can start small and keep adding more parts
2. One gets to share ideas and work with others and everyone has different ideas. Agile helps with trying out all ideas and make the project better.

Example on where the waterfall methodology is used: when one knows exactly what is needed to be done and there is no room for mistakes.
Examples on where the agile methodology is used: It is good when building is started by an idea and keep building and also accepting changes which are based on everyones ideas.

The difference between the agile and waterfall methodologies:
1. Waterfall is like following a guide step by step
2. Agile is like making a recipe with your own twists, testing along the way and adjusting as one go

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer : Is like a builder of the team, they write the code that makes the software work. The responsibilities includes : writing code, Building features, Fixing bugs, Collaborating with others.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: is the team's tester. They make sure the software works correctly and is free of bugs. The responsibilities includes: Testing softwares, Creating test plans,Reporting Bugs, Ensuring Quality.
3. Project Manager :is the team's organiser. They ensure that the projects stays on track, meet deadlines and everyones knows what to do. The responsibilities include : Planning the project, Managing the team, Tracking the progress and communicating with stakeholders
   


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs and VCS are essential tools in the software development process. They play a role in improving productivity, collaboration and code quality.
Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): 1. Efficiency, 2. Code assistance, 3. Debugging, 4. Project Management.
Examples of IDEs :
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
2. IntelliJ IDEA
3. Eclipse
Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS): 1. Collaboration, 2. History taking, 3. Branching and Merging, 4. Backup and Recovery
Examples of VCS:
1. Git
2. Subversion (SVN)
3. Mercurial


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challanges faced by software enginners vary from technical to team dynamics and personal development issues, here are the common issues and strategies to overcome them:
1. Managing Complex Codebases challenge: As software projects grow, the codebase becomes more complex, making it difficult to manage, understand and modify without introducing bugs. Strategies in solving them : 1. Modular design (breaking code into smaller independent modules that can be developed and tested separately), 2. Regular refactoring (Continously improve and clean up the code to make it more readable and maintanable), 3. Documentation, 4. Code reviews.
2. Keeping up with Rapid Technological Changes: The technology landscape evolves quickly with a new language, frameworks and tools emerging frequently. Strategies in solving them:1. Continous learning, 2.Networking, 3. Focusing on the fundamentals.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing : involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure that they work correctly. a unit is the smallest testable part of the software. Importance: 1. Catching bugs early, 2. Ensuring code quality, 3. Facilitating refactoring
2. Integration Testing: Focuses on testing how different units or componets of the software work together. it ensures that individual modules, when combine, interact correctly and produce the desired errors. Importance: 1. Detecting interface issues, 2. Verifying module interactions, 3. Preventing integration bugs.
3. System Testing: involves testing the complete and integrated software system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. This type of testing evaluates the software's overall behavior in a complete environment that simulates real-world usage. Importance : 1. Validating functionality, 2. Testing in a realistic environment, 3. ensuring compliance with requirements.
4. Accepatence Testing: is done to determine whether the software is ready for delivery to the customer. it is often the final testing phase and involves testing the software against the business requirements to ensure it meets the clients need. Importance : 1. Meeting user excpactations, 2. final verification, 3. Reducing pos-release issues

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting input prompts to effectively interact with AI models, particularly large language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The goal of prompt engineering is to formulate prompts that guide the AI to produce the desired responses, whether thatâ€™s generating text, answering questions, or performing other tasks.
Importance of Prompt engineering: 
1. Maximising AI performance
2. Reducing ambiguity
3. Customising responses
4. Enhancing AI-driven workflows
5. Enabling new use cases
6. improving model training and fine-tuning


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt :what are the requirements to get registered on ECSA?
Improved prompt : what are the requirements to get registered on ECSA when one has a national diploma in civil engineering? 
An improved prompt is more effective for several reasons, primarily due to its clarity, specificity, and alignment with the intended outcome
